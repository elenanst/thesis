One distinct component of the toolbox is Consultant, an advice-giving expert system, which assists a domain expert to choose and use a suitable algorithm for his learning problem. The University of Aberdeen has been responsible for the design and implementation of Consultant.Consultant's knowledge and domain is unusual in several respects. Its knowledge represents the integrated expertise of ten algorithm developers, whose algorithms offer a range of ML techniques; but also some algorithms use fairly similar approaches. The lack of an agreed ML terminology was the initial impetus for an extensive, associated help system. From an MLT user's point of view, an ML beginner requires significant assistance with terminology and techniques, and can benefit from having access to previous, successful applications of ML to similar problems; but in contrast" # " a more experienced user of ML does not wish constant supervision. This paper describes Consultant, discusses the methods used to achieve the required flexibility of use, and compares Consultant's similarities and distinguishing features with more standard expert system applications.INTRODUCTIONThe Machine Learning Toolbox (MLT), an Esprit project (P2154), provides an integrated toolbox of ten Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.

Recently, a subcommunity of machine learning has focused on solving this problem with Sequential Model-based Bayesian Optimization (SMBO), demonstrating substantial successes in many applications.

In this paper we mimic a strategy human domain experts use: speed up optimization by starting from promising configurations that performed well on similar datasets.

To validate our approach, we perform extensive experiments with two established SMBO frameworks (Spearmint and SMAC) with complementary strengths; optimizing two machine learning frameworks on 57 datasets. Our initialization procedure yields mild improvements for low-dimensional hyperparameter optimization and substantially improves the state of the art for the more complex combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem.},

title="Global Optimization of Stochastic Black-Box Systems via Sequential Kriging Meta-Models",
journal="Journal of Global Optimization",
year="2006",
volume="34",
number="3",
pages="441--466",
abstract="This paper proposes a new method that extends the efficient global optimization to address stochastic black-box systems. The method is based on a kriging meta-model that provides a global prediction of the objective values and a measure of prediction uncertainty at every point. The criterion for the infill sample selection is an augmented expected improvement function with desirable properties for stochastic responses. The method is empirically compared with the revised simplex search, the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation, and the DIRECT methods using six test problems from the literature. An application case study on an inventory system is also documented. The results suggest that the proposed method has excellent consistency and efficiency in finding global optimal solutions, and is particularly useful for expensive systems.",

abstract ={A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables, which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n + 1) vertices of a general simplex, followed by the replacement of the vertex with the highest value by another point. The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.},

abstract="The Support Vector Machine algorithm is sensitive to the choice of parameter settings. If these are not set correctly, the algorithm may have a substandard performance. Suggesting a good setting is thus an important problem. We propose a meta-learning methodology for this purpose and exploit information about the past performance of different settings. The methodology is applied to set the width of the Gaussian kernel. We carry out an extensive empirical evaluation, including comparisons with other methods (fixed default ranking; selection based on cross-validation and a heuristic method commonly used to set the width of the SVM kernel). We show that our methodology can select settings with low error while providing significant savings in time. Further work should be carried out to see how the methodology could be adapted to different parameter setting tasks.",

 abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, ..., y<sub>n</sub> are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters θ. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

From the data, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been derived for 188 congeners. The main determinants of mutagenicity are the hydrophobicity (modeled by octanol/water partition coefficients) and the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals calculated using the AM1 method. It is also shown that chemicals possessing three or more fused rings possess much greater mutagenic potency than compounds with one or two fused rings. Since the QSAR is based on a very wide range in structural variation, aromatic rings from benzene to coronene are included as well as many different types of heterocycles, it is a significant step toward a predictive toxicology of value in the design of less mutagenic bioactive compounds.},
